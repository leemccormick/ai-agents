# Module: accounts.py

This module provides a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It includes functionalities to create an account, manage funds, perform share transactions, and report on account holdings and performance.

## Class: Account

### Description:
The `Account` class manages user account operations, share transactions, and provides information about the account holdings, balance, and profit or loss.

### Attributes:
- **username (str):** The username associated with the account.
- **initial_deposit (float):** The initial amount deposited into the account.
- **balance (float):** The current cash balance in the account.
- **holdings (dict):** A dictionary representing the number of shares held for each stock symbol.
- **transactions (list):** A list of transaction records, including deposits, withdrawals, and share trades.

### Methods:

#### `__init__(self, username: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
- Initializes a new account with a username and initial deposit.
- Sets the initial balance to the amount deposited and records the initial transaction.

#### `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Deposits a specified amount of funds into the account and updates the transaction history.

#### `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
- Tries to withdraw a specified amount of funds from the account.
- Returns `True` if the withdrawal was successful, `False` otherwise, and prevents negative balance.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Purchases a specified quantity of shares for a given stock symbol if sufficient funds are available.
- Records the transaction and updates holdings.
- Returns `True` if the purchase was successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Sells a specified quantity of shares for a given stock symbol if sufficient shares are available.
- Records the transaction and updates holdings.
- Returns `True` if the sale was successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
- Calculates and returns the total value of the shares currently held in the account based on current share prices.

- Returns a dictionary of the current holdings (number of shares) for each stock symbol.

#### `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`
- Returns a list of all transactions made on the account, including deposits, withdrawals, and trades.

## Helper Function (Outside the Class)

- A supplied function that returns the current market price for the given share symbol.
- For testing implementation, returns fixed prices for 'AAPL', 'TSLA', and 'GOOGL'.

This detailed design outlines the class structure, methods, and functionalities required to fulfill the system requirements described. The methods ensure that financial operations consider constraints such as negative balances and unauthorized transactions.
