A simple Point-of-Sale (POS) system designed for small to mid-sized restaurants.

- Add menu items (with quantity) to a customerâ€™s order/cart.
- Remove or update items in the cart.
- Automatically calculate subtotal, tax, and total.
- Submit the order to the kitchen or mark it as paid.

Additional features:
- Apply discounts or promo codes.
- Track item availability (e.g., out-of-stock).
- Generate digital or printable receipts.

The system will be single-user and optimized for tablet use in demo environments.
