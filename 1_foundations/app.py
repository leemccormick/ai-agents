Author: Lee McCormick
Description: A Gradio-based chatbot that represents Lee on his website with quality control

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Environment Setup:
   - Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     PUSHOVER_USER=your_pushover_user_token
     PUSHOVER_TOKEN=your_pushover_app_token

2. Required Directory Structure:
   project_root/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ me/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ linkedin.pdf        # Your LinkedIn profile PDF
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ibm_resume.pdf     # Your resume PDF
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ccc_transcript.pdf # Your transcript PDF
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ summary.txt        # A text file containing your professional summary

3. Install Dependencies:
   pip install python-dotenv openai requests pypdf gradio pydantic

4. Running the Application:
   Method 1 (Direct Python):
   python app.py

   Method 2 (Using uvicorn):
   uvicorn app:interface --reload

   Method 3 (With virtual environment):
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python app.py

USAGE NOTES:
- The application will start a local server (typically at http://127.0.0.1:7860)
- Open the URL in your web browser to interact with the chat interface
- The bot uses both OpenAI and Google's Gemini API for different functions
- Pushover integration is used for notifications of user interactions
- Quality control is implemented using Gemini for response evaluation

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Ensure all API keys are valid and properly set in .env
- Check that all required PDF files are readable and properly formatted
- Verify that the 'me' directory contains all required files
- Monitor the console output for any error messages
