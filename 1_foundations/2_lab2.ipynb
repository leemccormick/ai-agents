Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

      "[\"The relationship between cognitive biases and free will is complex, and philosophers have debated this topic extensively. Here's a nuanced exploration of the issue:\\n\\n**Cognitive biases and free will: A nuanced view**\\n\\nWhile cognitive biases can influence decision-making, they do not necessarily negate the existence of free will. Free will refers to the ability to make choices that are not entirely determined by external factors, such as genetic predispositions, environmental conditions, or past experiences.\\n\\nCognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking and behavior that arise from mental representations, heuristics, and the way our brains process information. They can affect decision-making, but they do not completely eliminate the possibility of free will.\\n\\n**Three possible perspectives on cognitive bias and free will**\\n\\n1. **Compatibilist view**: This perspective argues that free will is compatible with the presence of cognitive biases. According to this view, while cognitive biases may influence decision-making, they do not preclude the existence of free will. Humans have a capacity for self-reflection, reasoning, and deliberation that allows them to make choices that are in line with their values and goals, even if those choices are shaped by cognitive biases.\\n2. **Libertarian view**: This perspective posits that free will requires the absence of cognitive biases. According to this view, if cognitive biases are present, then our decisions are determined by factors outside of our control, and we should not be held morally responsible for them.\\n3. **Naturalized view**: This perspective argues that true freedom is an emergent property of neural and psychological processes. From a naturalistic perspective, cognitive biases are inherent to human reasoning and decision-making, and they do not necessarily preclude free will.\\n\\n**How might the concept of moral responsibility change in this context?**\\n\\nIf we accept that cognitive biases can influence choice-making but do not entirely negate the existence of free will, then our understanding of moral responsibility may shift. Here are some possible implications:\\n\\n1. **Moral agency**: Emphasizing the role of cognitive biases in decision-making might lead to a more nuanced understanding of moral agency. We recognize that humans are complex systems with multiple influences on their values and choices.\\n2. **Accountability and blame**: The presence of cognitive biases might temper our expectations for accountability and blame. Instead of holding individuals entirely responsible for their actions, we acknowledge the role of bias in shaping decision-making.\\n3. **Self-reflection and rehabilitation**: Recognizing cognitive biases as a factor in decision-making could lead to a greater emphasis on self-reflection, learning from mistakes, and seeking support to overcome biases.\\n4. **Rehabilitation over punishment**: From a moral responsibility perspective, focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment might become more relevant. This would prioritize restorative justice, therapy, and education to combat cognitive biases.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the relationship between cognitive biases and free will is multifaceted, and our understanding of its impact on free will is still evolving. While cognitive biases can shape decision-making, they do not entirely negate the existence of free will. The concept of moral responsibility may change in light of this nuanced view to accommodate for the complexities of human decision-making.\", \"The relationship between cognitive biases and free will is complex, and philosophers continue to debate whether individual choices are truly autonomous under the influence of biases. Here's a nuanced exploration of this topic:\\n\\n**Can biased decision-making still imply free will?**\\n\\nIn some arguments, even if an individual's decisions are heavily influenced by cognitive biases, they can still be said to have free will in the sense that they have made their own choices within the bounds of their knowledge and abilities at the time. This view holds that while external factors (like biases) can impact decision-making, individuals can still take responsibility for choosing between different options based on some degree of rational consideration.\\n\\nHowever, other philosophers argue that biases inevitably introduce a degree of external influence, which undermines the notion of free will. They contend that cognitive biases are beyond an individual's conscious control and should be considered when attributing agency or moral responsibility to actions.\\n\\n**The degrees of influence**\\n\\nThere are different levels of influence cognitive biases can have on decision-making:\\n\\n1.  **Minor nudges**: Minor biases, like confirmation bias, do not significantly impact overall judgments, but minor distortions that result in relatively minor errors.\\n2.  **Moderate influences**: More substantial biases, such as anchoring bias or availability heuristic, can sway decisions but are still within an individual's realm of awareness and control.\\n3.  **Major distortions**: Powerful cognitive biases, like confirmation bias with a large impact on daily routine or significant emotional investments in certain outcomes.\\n\\n**Implications for moral responsibility**\\n\\nGiven the varying degrees of influence cognitive biases have on decision-making, moral responsibility might need to be adjusted:\\n\\n1.  **Degrees of culpability**: For minor biases, individuals might still be held accountable, with proportionally reduced culpability.\\n2.  **Moderate accountability**: When more significant biases influence decisions, the perpetrator should be partially accountable.\\n3.  **Maximum accountability**: In cases where cognitive biases profoundly impair rational judgment or lead to severe consequences, maximum accountability and appropriate corrective action (e.g., counseling) might be warranted.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the impact of cognitive biases on decision-making can raise questions about free will, we must differentiate between minor and major distortions. Even with slight influences, individuals are still considered accountable, whereas when biases significantly impact choices, more substantial responsibility measures may apply.\\n\\nFree will acknowledges the potential for individual autonomy in making decisions while respecting that external factors influence our judgments.\", 'How would you approach solving the ethical dilemma of prioritizing individual privacy over public safety in the context of surveillance technologies, and what specific factors would influence your decision-making process?', 'How might we reconcile the philosophical tension between determinism and moral responsibility?

      "The relationship between cognitive biases and free will is complex, and philosophers have debated this topic extensively. Here's a nuanced exploration of the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cognitive biases and free will: A nuanced view**\n",
      "\n",
      "While cognitive biases can influence decision-making, they do not necessarily negate the existence of free will. Free will refers to the ability to make choices that are not entirely determined by external factors, such as genetic predispositions, environmental conditions, or past experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking and behavior that arise from mental representations, heuristics, and the way our brains process information. They can affect decision-making, but they do not completely eliminate the possibility of free will.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Three possible perspectives on cognitive bias and free will**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Compatibilist view**: This perspective argues that free will is compatible with the presence of cognitive biases. According to this view, while cognitive biases may influence decision-making, they do not preclude the existence of free will. Humans have a capacity for self-reflection, reasoning, and deliberation that allows them to make choices that are in line with their values and goals, even if those choices are shaped by cognitive biases.\n",
      "2. **Libertarian view**: This perspective posits that free will requires the absence of cognitive biases. According to this view, if cognitive biases are present, then our decisions are determined by factors outside of our control, and we should not be held morally responsible for them.\n",
      "3. **Naturalized view**: This perspective argues that true freedom is an emergent property of neural and psychological processes. From a naturalistic perspective, cognitive biases are inherent to human reasoning and decision-making, and they do not necessarily preclude free will.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How might the concept of moral responsibility change in this context?**\n",
      "\n",
      "If we accept that cognitive biases can influence choice-making but do not entirely negate the existence of free will, then our understanding of moral responsibility may shift. Here are some possible implications:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Moral agency**: Emphasizing the role of cognitive biases in decision-making might lead to a more nuanced understanding of moral agency. We recognize that humans are complex systems with multiple influences on their values and choices.\n",
      "2. **Accountability and blame**: The presence of cognitive biases might temper our expectations for accountability and blame. Instead of holding individuals entirely responsible for their actions, we acknowledge the role of bias in shaping decision-making.\n",
      "3. **Self-reflection and rehabilitation**: Recognizing cognitive biases as a factor in decision-making could lead to a greater emphasis on self-reflection, learning from mistakes, and seeking support to overcome biases.\n",
      "4. **Rehabilitation over punishment**: From a moral responsibility perspective, focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment might become more relevant. This would prioritize restorative justice, therapy, and education to combat cognitive biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the relationship between cognitive biases and free will is multifaceted, and our understanding of its impact on free will is still evolving. While cognitive biases can shape decision-making, they do not entirely negate the existence of free will. The concept of moral responsibility may change in light of this nuanced view to accommodate for the complexities of human decision-making.\n",

      "# Response from competitor 2\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between cognitive biases and free will is complex, and philosophers continue to debate whether individual choices are truly autonomous under the influence of biases. Here's a nuanced exploration of this topic:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Can biased decision-making still imply free will?**\n",
      "\n",
      "In some arguments, even if an individual's decisions are heavily influenced by cognitive biases, they can still be said to have free will in the sense that they have made their own choices within the bounds of their knowledge and abilities at the time. This view holds that while external factors (like biases) can impact decision-making, individuals can still take responsibility for choosing between different options based on some degree of rational consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, other philosophers argue that biases inevitably introduce a degree of external influence, which undermines the notion of free will. They contend that cognitive biases are beyond an individual's conscious control and should be considered when attributing agency or moral responsibility to actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The degrees of influence**\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different levels of influence cognitive biases can have on decision-making:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Minor nudges**: Minor biases, like confirmation bias, do not significantly impact overall judgments, but minor distortions that result in relatively minor errors.\n",
      "2.  **Moderate influences**: More substantial biases, such as anchoring bias or availability heuristic, can sway decisions but are still within an individual's realm of awareness and control.\n",
      "3.  **Major distortions**: Powerful cognitive biases, like confirmation bias with a large impact on daily routine or significant emotional investments in certain outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implications for moral responsibility**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the varying degrees of influence cognitive biases have on decision-making, moral responsibility might need to be adjusted:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Degrees of culpability**: For minor biases, individuals might still be held accountable, with proportionally reduced culpability.\n",
      "2.  **Moderate accountability**: When more significant biases influence decisions, the perpetrator should be partially accountable.\n",
      "3.  **Maximum accountability**: In cases where cognitive biases profoundly impair rational judgment or lead to severe consequences, maximum accountability and appropriate corrective action (e.g., counseling) might be warranted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the impact of cognitive biases on decision-making can raise questions about free will, we must differentiate between minor and major distortions. Even with slight influences, individuals are still considered accountable, whereas when biases significantly impact choices, more substantial responsibility measures may apply.\n",
